# Introduction/Background

We all depend on crops as a major part of our global food supply, and as a result, the swift detection of crop diseases is essential to maximizing the output of our fields and ensuring the health of the ingredients used in everyday products. However, manual detection of plant diseases is tedious; during the process of identification, disease continues to propagate rapidly. It also requires a high level of expertise and can be highly error prone [3]. Many of these reasons have spurred research efforts to use machine learning and deep learning to train models to identify diseased plants as well as the specific type of disease in order to aid in quick prevention of the spread of harmful blights that can ruin fields of crops. For example, Kurlkarni et al. predicted several types of diseases each for images of five species of crops using a random forest classifier and was able to achieve an average accuracy of 93% [4]. Other papers have ventured beyond traditional machine learning methods; one group used CNNs to classify a dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaves to achieve a 99.3% accuracy [1].

We plan to use the PlantVillage dataset, which contains 54,303 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves from 13 species, including apples, corn, grapes, and tomatoes, with various diseases such as black rot, common rust, and bacterial spot. It can be found here, and the below figure shows some example images from the dataset.
